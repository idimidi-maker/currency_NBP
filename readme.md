Currency converter

This application calculates PLN to GBP and GBP to PLN.

Current exchange rate is being downloaded from NBP Web API.

At first, user decides if he wants to convert PLN to GBP, or on the contrary and type in the value.
Then, today's exchange rate is seen on the screen.
Finally, the program calculates the value and shows it on the screen.

To create this application, and successfully download data from API, I've used gson library.
NBP.java file (located in src folder) contains the whole code. Please open NBP.java file and run the code - application should be working fine.
What's more, make sure that gson library is implemented to your environment.


Application has been created using Java language, version 15.
